      <h3><Strong>Introduction About Myself</Strong></h3>
      <p>I am currently going to CSULB and working on a bachelor degree for Computer Science. While this is website was made for a project I figured I would write actual stuff about me.</p>
      <p>So at the time of writing this, I am 18 years old. I originally went into Computer Science due to interest stemming from me messing around with modding different video games. Due to this, I would like to become a video game designer, but I am keeping my options open and learning about various other parts of computer science (like website creation!).</p>

      <h3><Strong>My Hobbies</Strong></h3>
      <p>This column is a list of my hobbies:</p>
      <ul>
    	<li>Video Games (Particularly Fighting Games and RPGs)</li>
    	<li>Reading Books</li>
    	<li>Playing the Saxophone</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
    	<li>Tabletop RPGs (Dungeons and Dragons, Monsters and Other Childish Things, Powered by the ApocalypseSystem, FATE, and various others)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><Strong>Personal Projects I'm working on</Strong></h3>
      <p>These projects may never be publicized but a snippet of info about these projects:</p>
      <h4>Big Ol Robot Crossover (BORC):</h4>
      <p>A Tabletop RPG system I'm working on that all about teenangers who are paired up to pilot Mechas to fight Eldritch Monsters from stuff like HP Lovecraft. This system is a combination of the various TTRPG games I really like.</p>
      <h4>My First Model Swap:</h4>
      <p>A modding project where I first have to 3D model a character and clothes for them then replace a character in the game with them. Probably will be done with a first person shooter since those seem easier to implement it in. Main reason this is so big is because I have to learn how to blender to make a character model/clothes.</p>
